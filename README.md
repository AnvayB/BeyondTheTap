# Beyond The Tap: Water Quality Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting water quality in various cities in the Bay Area using pipeline infrastructure data and various machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed on water quality data to understand patterns, make predictions, and provide insights for water quality management.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the analysis:

- `Project_EDA.ipynb`: Initial Exploratory Data Analysis of the water quality dataset
- `Preprocessing.ipynb`: Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps
- `Clustering_LightGBM.ipynb`: Clustering analysis using LightGBM
- `HistGBClassifier.ipynb`: Classification using Histogram-based Gradient Boosting
- `RandomForest-Meet.ipynb`: Random Forest implementation for water quality prediction

## Documentation
- `BeyondTheTap_presentation.pdf`: Final project presentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (to be installed):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - lightgbm
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
The combined water quality dataset can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ou3TkkVAeMPuiIxrFZ_sR36mHRu1pedG/view?usp=sharing)


## Project Workflow
1. Start with `Project_EDA.ipynb` to understand the data
2. Use `Preprocessing.ipynb` to prepare the data
3. Explore different models:
   - Clustering analysis in `Clustering_LightGBM.ipynb`
   - Classification in `HistGBClassifier.ipynb`
   - Random Forest predictions in `RandomForest-Meet.ipynb`

## Results
The project results and findings are presented in `BeyondTheTap_presentation.pdf`.
